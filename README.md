In this agricultural data science project, the primary objective is to enhance the efficiency of farming practices through the application of machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises key agricultural parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, and pH levels. These variables influence crop growth, and understanding their interplay is crucial for optimizing agricultural output.
The project aims to predict the types of crops (e.g., Rice, Maize, Chickpea, etc.) based on these parameters. Leveraging data science and artificial intelligence, the project seeks to provide farmers with tools to maximize yield per acre, addressing the pressing need to feed a growing global population.

3.Model Selection:
Selected and implemented the Naive Bayesian, Bayesian Belief Network, 
Decision Tree, LDA, Neural Network, and K-NN models.


4.Evaluation:
Evaluated models using various metrics and visualizations.


5.Optimization:
Explored model hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
